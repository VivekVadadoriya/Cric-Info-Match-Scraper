# Cric-Info-Match-Scraper

In this project, I have scrapped the team's data of cricket WorldCup 2019 from [CricInfo](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2019-1144415). And extracted in the form of an excel and pdf. In short, I processed raw web data into different forms.   

I made this project to learn node.js and to explore various npm libraries. The purpose of this project is to learn via fun.
